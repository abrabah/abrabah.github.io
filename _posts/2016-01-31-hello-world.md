Hi, and welcome to my personal web site. This site is primarily a place where I will share my thoughts about tech in general, computer science
and other things that interests me at the moment. 
Being such a curious creature I highly doubt that I will run out of things to write about, the question is more likely whether 
I will find time to write about it all ;p



**PS:**
This page is hosted on [github](https://github.com/abrabah/abrabah.github.io) using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and 
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Have a look if you're curious!
