title: Notes to self 
excerpt: Nearly two years have passed since I graduated. What have I learned? 
---

Nearly two years have  passed since I left university and started my career as a software developer. 
The list below contains values that I have come to hold dearly and strive to live by. 

* **Don't assume** anything about the work you are doing. 
Create hypotheses, test them and verify the result. 

* **Try to learn some thing new every day**. Learning is not only fun,
 but it makes you able to see things from a different perspective.
 I really don't think it matters what you learn, as long as you learn something, keeping those brain cells of yours healthy.

* **Stay open and humble**, always listen to what others have to say. 
Never take people for granted because of their lower seniority or their lack of experience. 

* **Don't be afraid to fail**, welcome failure, learn from it and do better next time. 
Trying, failing and then trying again comes natural to most of us when we are younger.
That's how we learn complex tasks such as to walk, to talk or to ride a bicycle. 
Failing gives us valuable feedback and keeps us from doing the same mistakes again.
 It is therefore important to create environments where failure is encouraged and seen as a natural way towards success. 

* **Don't be a perfectionist**. 
As a student, I used to spend way too much time perfecting things, be it computer code or other assignments.
 In retrospect, I realise that the time I spent perfecting did not make a noticeable impact on the result, 
 it was really just all in my head.
 Try not to spend too much time on  an assignment before handing it off to someone else for feedback. 
 Constructive feedback should give you an indication on improvements worth doing and where those improvements should be done. 
   
* **Ask a lot of questions, even "stupid" ones**. Just as we tend to become more risk averse as we get older, 
we also become more reluctant to ask questions. 
I have seen this during my time at the university; students, me included, 
would withhold questions during lectures afraid the questions were too silly to ask. 

* **Don't become too comfortable with the present**. Nobody can accurately predict the future, 
but we can all agree that the future will look different from the past and the present, so don't lean too heavily on the present.

* **Treat everyone with respect**. Nothing else makes sense does it? Yet we live in a world full of discrimination. 
Try to counteract this by treating everyone with the respect they deserve, regardless of sex, skin color, background or education. 
We are all humans after all. 

* **Keep an open mind**, don't get stuck in your own way of thinking. 
Listen to what others have to say and admit when you are wrong.
