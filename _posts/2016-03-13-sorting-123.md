title: Sorting in 123
excerpt: I've been revisiting sorting algorithms lately, and I have the web app to prove it!
---



So I have been playing around with some sorting algorithms from the absolutely awesome book 
["Introduction to Algorithms"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms).
The result is a [nice little web application](/projects/sorting123) for visualizing and comparing various
sorting algorithms against each other. The twist here is that the algorithms are not compared in terms of raw speed, 
 but rather the number of swaps performed. 

I have implemented the following sorting algorithms; [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), 
[Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort),
[Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort), 
[Quick Sort with Lomuto partition scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Lomuto_partition_scheme), 
and [Quick Sort with Hoare partition scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Hoare_partition_scheme). 
It should not come as a surprise that Quick Sort gets sorting done with the least number of swaps performed. 
But hey, don't take my word for it, [do feel free to see for yourself](/projects/sorting123).
